## 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses (Easy)

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

    It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
    It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

    depth("") = 0
    depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
    depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
    depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'.
    It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.

## 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters (Medium)

You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in kilometers of the ith monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in kilometers per minute.

You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. However, the weapon takes one minute to charge. The weapon is fully charged at the very start.

You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.

Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.

 

Example 1:

Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the third monster.
All 3 monsters can be eliminated.

Example 2:

Input: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.

Example 3:

Input: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.

 

Constraints:

    n == dist.length == speed.length
    1 <= n <= 105
    1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 105

## 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses (Medium)

Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

    It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
    It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"

Example 3:

Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is either'(' , ')', or lowercase English letter.
