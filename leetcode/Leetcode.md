## 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses (Easy)

A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

    It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
    It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

    depth("") = 0
    depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
    depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
    depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.

For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '*', '/', '(', and ')'.
    It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.

## 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters (Medium)

You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in kilometers of the ith monster from the city.

The monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in kilometers per minute.

You have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. However, the weapon takes one minute to charge. The weapon is fully charged at the very start.

You lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.

Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.

 

Example 1:

Input: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the third monster.
All 3 monsters can be eliminated.

Example 2:

Input: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.

Example 3:

Input: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4]. You eliminate the first monster.
After a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.
You can only eliminate 1 monster.

 

Constraints:

    n == dist.length == speed.length
    1 <= n <= 105
    1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 105

## 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses (Medium)

Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

    It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
    It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"

Example 3:

Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is either'(' , ')', or lowercase English letter.

### 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order (Medium)

You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].

You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

    Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
    If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
    If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.

Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

 

Example 1:

Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.

Example 2:

Input: deck = [1,1000]
Output: [1,1000]

 

Constraints:

    1 <= deck.length <= 1000
    1 <= deck[i] <= 106
    All the values of deck are unique.
